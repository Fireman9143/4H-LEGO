            <h3>Why microPython?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                4H Robotics 3 requires text based code such as Python or C.  Python is a relatively easy language to learn, 
                and microPython is a version of Python that is optimized for use on microcontrollers. LEGO EV3 Mindstorm can take a microSD card
                with microPython installed on it and execute code written in Python.  Raspberry Pi microcontrollers can also run Python code to access the 
                General Purpose In/Out (GPIO) pins to read from sensors and run motors.  Controllers like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Beagle Bone 
                require custom built attachments, motor controllers, and a battery pack to operate robots.  They also need framework such as 3D printed
                chassis, arms, struts, etc to build the robot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully the EV3 Mindstorm handles most of the structure for us!

            <h3>How to get started?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Things you will need:
                <ul>
                    <li>LEGO EV3 Mindstorm</li>
                    <li>microSD card</li>
                    <li>microUSB cable to connect the EV3 to your computer</li>
                    <li>microSD card reader for your computer</li>
                    <li>Pixy Cam 2 sensor module FOR LEGO</li>
                </ul>
                The goal of this site is to bring all of the information and resources that are scattered around the internet into a "How to" guide
                that 4H clubs can follow.  Unfortunately, the EV3 Mindstorm is no longer made or supported by LEGO.  The current model is the Spike Prime
                (as of 2025).  I'll do my best to walk through all the microcontrollers and adapters needed to get your robot going.
