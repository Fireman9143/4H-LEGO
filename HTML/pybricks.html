            <h3>Getting the basics</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                It's super helpful to know how to program Python before you jump into using it for robotics.  I'll do my best to explain everything along the way, though
                you may want to learn about it before you start.  Here are a few youtube resources that I found very helpful:
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Start VS Code EV3 project</h3>
            <p>
                Now that everything is setup and ready, let's open VS Code and select the EV3 icon from the left menu. Select create new project and create a folder
                for all of the code that will go onto the EV3.  Be careful that you only load files here that you actually want to load on the robot.  If you accidentally 
                load extra files, the upload will take longer than it should.  Here is the screen you should see:
            </p>
            <img id="image" src=".\images\First screen.png" alt="First program screen">
            <p>
                The first line starts with a special syntax called the shebang which is #! followed by the micropython environment. 

                The next several lines are suggested imports from the pybricks library.  When you open the User Guide (remember the link when you click on the EV3 icon on
                the left side?), the PyBricks LEGO guide has a menu on the left side which matches the things that you are importing from. It's good to know about 
                nxtdevice and iodevices, but we won't really use those modules.  Here's what we really need:

                    <dd>Mailbox</dd>
                    <dd>LogicMailbox</dd>

                    <dd>TextMailbox</dd>
                </dl>
            </p>
            <p>
                You may notice that in the PyBricks library, each module has one or more classes.  In Python, classes allow us to use the class template multiple times, 
                each of them are called <i>instances</i>.  For example, in the sample code you can see <b>ev3 = EV3Brick</b>.  ev3 is the name of the instance of the 
                EV3Brick class. By making this instance, now we can use the methods that the class contains.  If you look back up at the imports on line 2, you can trace 
                back where to look in the documentation for what methods are available.  In this case, the EV3Brick class is from the hubs module.  The EV3Brick class 
                has access to buttons, light, speaker, screen, and battery.  Each of these parts has functions, or methods, that we can use. In this example, we are 
                using our ev3 instance to access the speaker and call the beep() function.
            </p>
            <h3>Simple motor and sensor program</h3>
            <p>
                In order to use a motor, we need to create an instance of the Motor class. If you go to the user guide and click on the ev3devices, you can see that the 
                Motor class can take 3 arguments. It must have the Port that it's connected to as a minimum. (A, B, C, D)  Now that we're actually writing code, it's 
                important to know that Python is VERY precise with case sensitivity.  That means that every letter has to be exactly upper case or lower case, depending 
                on the code.  For our Motor class, if we wrote motor(port.a) the program would crash. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to use the touch sensor, we also need to make an instance of it.  This is also in the ev3devices module, and it only needs the port.  Notice 
                that sensor ports start with a capital S (S1, S2, S3, S4).
            </p>
            <img id="code" src=".\images\motor turn.png" alt="Updated code for motor and touch sensor">
            <p>
                In our simple program, the <b>while True:</b> sets up a loop that goes forever, or unitl we break out of the loop on purpose. The next line uses an <b>if</b>
                statement to check if our touch sensor receives a press.  If it gets pressed, then the motor will use the <b>run_target</b> method to turn at 200 degrees per 
                second until it has turned 90 degrees. If the touch sensor doesn't get pressed during that loop, then it checks to see if the buttons are pressed on the robot.
                In this case, if any of the buttons are pressed it will break out of our loop, which exits the program.  It's important to remember that this <b>while True:</b>
                loop is looping through all the code many times each second.  Each time you press the touch sensor, the motor will turn 90 degrees.  The ev3.speaker.beep() 
                function only ran once because it is NOT inside the while loop.  Only the code under the loop will repeat.  Once we break, any code that we put after the loop
                will run.
            </p>
            <h3>Let's make a bigger program</h3>
            <p>
                Time to pause and discuss an important item with Python.  Whenever a program is run, everything is executed at startup.  This can be a problem if there are 
                other programs or modules being imported into our program.  The way we solve this is by putting all of our code inside a main function, and then using special 
                syntax to call the main function when we want to run the program.  We'll implement this in the next code and it will make more sense.
            </p>
            <img id="code" src=".\images\drivebase intro.png" alt="Code with DriveBase added">
            <p>
                There's several things to notice here.  
                <ul>
                    <li>We moved all of the objects underneath our <i>def main():</i> function.</li>
                    <li>We have made two more instances of the Motor class.  We now have one motor named my_motor which is our medium motor,
                        one motor named motor_L and another named motor_R which are the driving motors.</li>
                    <li>We have then used the two drive motors 
                        in our DriveBase class from the robotics module.  Using the DriveBase allows both motors to be used at the same timne.</li>
                    <li>We called the DriveBase <i>engine</i> and used three of the functions to test our accuracy.
                        <ul>
                            <li>By driving straight for 1000mm, we can measure the accuracy of our wheel_diameter measurement.  The smaller the diameter, the more that 
                                the motor will turn to get to 1000mm, which could go too far.  The larger the diameter, the less the motor will turn, and it won't go far
                                enough.</li>
                            <li>By turning 360 degrees, we can measure the accuracy of the axle_track.  The smaller the axle track, the less the motors will have to move 
                                to make the turn, which might make us not turn enough.  The larger the axle_track, the more it has to turn, which means it might turn too much.</li>
                            <li>Using the <i>stop()</i> method turns off the DriveBase.  This will be important later, if we want to use each drive motor independently.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>If you look at the last two lines, you can see the if-name-main guard that was mentioned earlier.  As you learn how to write Python, this will be explained
                        in more detail.  For now, it's good enough just to know to use it like this.</li>
                </ul>   
                By the way, you can name all of these variables anything you want.  Python 
                has a few rules about naming variables, but it doesn't matter what we name them as far as the program is concerned. It has to start with a letter.  By convention,
                python uses snake_case, which is all lower case; and if there's more than one word they are connected with the underscore ( _ ).  
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we're getting comfortable with writing code, using sensors for input, and motors for output; let's look at the built-in examples.  Make sure 
                your files are saved and close the folder.  Click on the EV3 icon in the left menu and select <i>Explorer Example Projects</i>. Look for the <i>Line
                    Follow</i> program and open it up.  It will ask you to select where the Line Follow Folder will store the code.  Once it's open it should look like this:
            </p>
            <img id="code" src=".\images\LineFollow.png" alt="Example Line Follow code">
            <p>
                They give us a lot of comments to help us understand what's happening.  Comments in Python start with a # on each line.  In this code they are green text.
                The example doesn't use the if-name-main guard, and that's ok.  It's good practice to start using it in your own code, especially as the programs get more 
                and more complex.  Let's look at this code line by line.  (After all, python reads all code left to right and top to bottom too)
                <ul>
                    <li>At the top, we still have the shebang that tells the program to use micropython.</li>
                    <li>This time we only import the modules and classes that we are going to use. Up to now we have just let the program import all the possible options
                        for us.  If you look back at that code, you'll notice that any modules and classes that we used were white, and any that we didn't use were gray.
                    </li>
                    <li>We initialize our left motor and right motor</li>
                    <li>We initialize out color sensor.</li>
                    <li>We initialize our DriveBase.</li>
                    <li>Next is something new.  We initialize some variables that we haven't seen yet.  We'll look closer at them in a moment.  For now, let's just look at
                        what they are and how we wrote them.  In Python, if we want a variable to be a constant we write it in ALL CAPS.  This doesn't actually prevent us
                        from changing it, it just serves as a reminder that once we set it we should leave it alone.
                        <ul>
                            <li>BLACK</li>
                            <li>WHITE</li>
                            <li>threshold</li>
                            <li>DRIVE_SPEED</li>
                            <li>PROPORTIONAL_GAIN</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>We make a <i>while True:</i> loop that we've seen before.</li>
                    <li>For the line follow we calculate the <i>deviation</i> from the line by reading the <i>line_sensor.reflection()</i> and subtracting
                    our <i>threshold</i> variable.  The <i>threshold</i> is the average that our color sensor reads when it's on the line <i>(BLACK)</i> and 
                    off the line <i>(WHITE)</i>. We can write a short program to read from the sensor to determine what those values should be.</li>
                    <li>Next we set our <i>turn_rate</i> which is our <i>PROPORTIONAL_GAIN</i> constant multiplied by the <i>deviation</i>.</li>
                    <li>Last we tell our DriveBase, which we called <i>robot</i> to drive based on those values.  The <i>drive()</i> function can take several
                    arguments, and we are giving two.  The speed is our<i>DRIVE_SPEED</i> constant and the turn rate is our <i>turn_rate</i> variable.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
