            <h3>Getting a code editor</h3>
            <p>
                There are many code editors available.  One of the popular editors is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>.  This is a great starting
                place for 4H robotics because there is an EV3 extension that can easily be installed in the editor. Because it is easy, accessible, and available on all
                operating systems, that is the editor that will be used in this example.
            </p>

            <h3>Installing dependencies</h3>
            <p>
                Now that the editor is installed, open it up and install dependencies.  These are the extensions that VS Code will use to write Python and install it to the EV3.
                You will need Python, ev3dev-browser, and LEGO Mindstorms EV3 microPython.  Just click on the 4 boxes on the left menu in VS Code for extensions and use the 
                search box to find "python" and "EV3".
            </p>

            <p>
                The LEGO extension will add a new icon to the menu bar on the left side of the screen. Your screen may not look exactly like mine, as long as you have the EV3 
                icon, it will be fine. Click on the EV3 icon and you will have 3 options.  First thing to do is "open the user guide"
            </p>
            <img id="image" src="EV3 icon.png" alt="Image of VS Code EV3 block">
            <p>
                Now that you have the LEGO Mindstorms user guide open, we can follow their instructions to flash ev3dev to a microSD card and connect to the robot.
                They have instructions for flashing the card with a program called Balena Etcher, which you will have to download.  There are other flasher programs
                that will also work.  If you are trying to use an old SD card, Etcher may not be able to format the card.  If this happens, you may need to use a 
                tool called DiskPart to format the card. Here is a screenshot of the instructions for diskpart.  BE CAREFUL! THIS IS A POWERFUL TOOL AND YOU WILL LOSE 
                ALL DATA ON THE CARD!

            <p>
                Now that we have a code editor with python and EV3 installed, and an EV3 robot with the EV3DEV micropython environment installed, 
                we are ready to start coding!
